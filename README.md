# data
This is a dataset of metal surface defects

This dataset contains three types of metal surface defects, namely scratches, rapid corrosion, and small spots
It is suggested that fast corrosion and small spots can be used as a class of defects，Because they differ only in patch size, other features are the same (features observed after image preprocessing).

Includes grayscale pictures, color pictures
